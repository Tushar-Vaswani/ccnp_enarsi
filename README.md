# CCNP ENARSI LABS
My CCNP Enarsi Journey!

Hey there, Thank you for visiting!

I am a Packet People! I love configuring Networks and troubleshooting them!

Help me build this repository so that anyone who aspires to clear the CCNP ENARSI exam can go through these labs and help boost their career!

And yes, add me some suggestions or email me at tushar.1801@gmail.com

There are some topics extra to just clear the basics (like NAT, ACL, DHCP and DNS) - The actual struggle starts from EIGRP..

I hope this will be of some help! Thanks for reading this!

A Big Shoutout to my Mentor- Atul Sharma (You'll really love his content) - Network Kings- https://nwkings.com
